                        Since I moved here from Philippines and reconnected with friends and hiking buddies; we made a point 
                        that the highest peak in the continental 48 should be the first one. Omar my brother from another mother is the one who does all the reservations, permits and all the logistics. The journey begun in Lone Pine California, about 5 hours drive away from Los Angeles; it’s in Inyo National Forest to be exact. The national park is above 8000 feet of elevation, making it one of the highest trail head in California. We plan on camping in the trailhead to acclimatize unfortunately, we cannot find a spot to pitch our tents. We, then, decided to drive back to Lone Pine again to find a room to spend the night with. Bad move for someone who wants to acclimatize, so to speak.

                    It was 9:00am when we started the hike and at 8000 feet, the trail is somewhat the same as any other trail I have been. Flora and Fauna’s are the same as well, it’s just another day of hike, to describe it. It’s the first week of summer, the mountain is loaded with hikers, backpackers and casual tourists alike. So, we got to talk to people along the trail making it somehow entertaining.

                    At 10,000 feet the trail and scenery is getting interesting. Colder wind in your skin because of elevation and colossal boulders is exhilarating. By that time, I have the feeling that it is going to be one of the hikes of my life.

                        True enough, that gut feeling is starting to get into reality. At this time the trail is getting more steeper and challenging. I paced my self well enough that I ended up leading the trail rather than pushing it as sweeper. Reaching the 11,000 feet elevation, big headaches kicks in. Boom! Altitude sickness ate everything away. I had to stop to wore my jacket since it was cold then, around 50’s maybe. I started walking slowly and pushing it hard to reach the campsite at 12,000 feet.

                    Upon reaching the campsite around 5:00 pm, I fix all tent and immediately took aspirin to ease the headache. It was comparable to having hangover after a hard night of boozing. We then, did all the usual stuff like cooking dinner and tons of stories to begin the night. I don’t have the appetite for a dinner, maybe because of my altitude sickness. I only had few of whatever we cooked that night. I’m more focused on sleeping the whole night out for a good night rest. Because, the next day is the summit bid, and I am optimistic that my altitude problem will go bye-bye the next day.

                    I woke up with the next day with pounding headache still, but the view is awesome with the sunrise at 12,000 feet in your panoramic view, it is a kick-starter. We are all excited to conquer the summit even I have a head pain. We had breakfast which I had little of it, my appetite hasn’t back yet. We secure water in the near pond which we need plenty to hike another 2000 plus feet more. Upon starting the hike, we immediately encounter hikers going down thinking that they already reached the summit I asked them; realizing that they are going down because some of them also suffers from altitude sickness. I immediately realized that this day is going to be different.

                        My immediate rest stop at 99 switchbacks, one of the needed rest of my entire hiking life. At this time, I am doing one step at a time. My spirits are all up to tell and I am well optimistic that I can do this. I took ample amount of pain reliever pills already but the headache seems want to stay until the hike ends. The great views and scenery is giving me strength to continue and nothing can stop me, not even my pounding head.

                    They waited for me and regrouped at the Trail Crest. At 13,700 feet, it is the boundary of 2 national park, Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Park. As the elevation gains the headache is hiking up as well. I met a John Muir Trail thru hiker who’s about to end her journey with a Whitney summit bid. It motivates me more to continue my torturing hike. So, I continued hiking since I only got 1000 more feet to tackle.

                    After a couple of hours more I decided to go back to the High Camp. Altitude sickness ate me alive that I cannot continue  anymore. I asked my friend Erwin go passed me and continue to hike the summit; but he is so compassionate that he wants me safe and decided to stay and look after me (thanks bud).

                The story doesn't stop there, the hike down is the one of the challenging part of this trip. The altitude sickness plays big part of it, however, to make matters most, I forgot that I haven't had any meal for the day, It was 3:00 pm then. I guess my body is looking for any source of energy that it can't produce anymore (wild guess). Or, maybe I am really dead tired and exhausted, it could have been an hour or so to get back at High Camp but it took me 3 hours, again thanks to Erwin for being there. I literally got crazy up there, at 12,000 feet I am talking non-sense. I remembered lying down in the ground for over an hour doing nothing. But, again, I have to push it down. I don't know where did I get the strength to continue but I was able to stand and walk slowly.

                    With one step at a time we eventually got back in the high camp. And, guess what, that altitude sickness it's all gone. What a time to come, it feels like I can go up now and conquer the summit. But it was 7:00pm then; I thank Erwin for being there and we just prepared dinner.

                    Day 3 is a fun filled day, since altitude sickness is well gone. Going down form High Camp to trail head took us less than 4 hours of hikes and laughter. Although I wasn't able to make it to the summit; and I feel bad that because of me Erwin wasn't able to do it too my spirit is high up. The whole trip itself is worth the time. Mt. Whitney is there and definitely going nowhere. I'll be back with a vengeance and the whole trip will be well documented as well.
