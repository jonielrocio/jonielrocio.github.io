                    <p id="p1st">It was the time of the year, when us, long-time buddies,     dating back decades ago gather to do one thing we love,       backpacking. This time, it’s the White Mountains in New       Hampshire, The Pemi Loop trail. It’s about 31.5 rugged       miles with 9000 feet elevation gain to tackle in a three-     day hiking journey.  It all started in The Lincoln Woods     Visitor Center, about less than 6 miles east of Route 112     from exit 32 in I-93. There is a very large parking in the   area where you need to secure fee, $5 daily you can locate   the box with envelope there to pay for it and, or, $20 for   the whole week to be paid in the WM shelter.

                    <p>This is where the journey all began, it is a 1.4miles walk   in the park hike before reaching the Osseo Trail junction.   Then, the real hike begins here, hiking Mt. Liberty to       start    with is tiring yet fun and rewarding.

                <p>It is about 4 hours or so to reach the Liberty Spring Campsite    to spend the night with. We took our time in the first day        since Little Foot (trail name) came straight from Los Angeles    to New York. It was a great camp site, with wooden platform,      you have to pay $7 a night per tent, which I believe very        reasonable, thanks to AMC for creating them.

                    Day 2 is the fun day, where as we are all rested the whole night in a cozy tent in about winterish summer 
                    night. The temperature in White Mountains is very unpredictable, in a summer day you can go as high as 
                    90°  to 35° at night. We refill our water here because the next water source is in Garfield camp site; which is about 6 miles from here. We then, started the trek around 8am, we are about to tackle 4 peaks and 10 miles or so of this jagged trail.

                    For the second day we planned on reaching Guyot campsite. A whole day of hiking is the plan, but we 
                    cut the 2nd day short since one of us suffered from knee pain. We ended up camping in Garfield 
                    campsite. Garfield campsite is about 6 miles from Liberty campsite, with yet, another cozy tent platform
                    and water source. We decided not to finish the hike and took the by-pass trail the next day going back 
                    to the parking area.
